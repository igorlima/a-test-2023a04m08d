## CSS

### Grid

- The power of conditional styling with `@container` **plus** CSS Grid Layout
  - <details markdown="block"> <summary> <i>intro</i> </summary>
     
    The `@container` CSS at-rule applies styles based on specific conditions.
    It allows you to define a condition group rule that filters style
    declarations and applies them to a containment context only when the
    condition is met.
    - Here's how it works:
      - Style declarations are evaluated based on a defined condition.
      - When the condition is true, the styles are applied to the container.
      - The condition is re-evaluated whenever the container's size or value changes.
     
    By using `@container`, you can create dynamic and responsive layouts that
    adapt to different conditions, making your web development process more
    efficient and effective.
