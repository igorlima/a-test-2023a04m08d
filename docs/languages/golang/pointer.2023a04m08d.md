# Pointer

## What is a pointer?

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. In other words, it is a reference to the memory location of a variable. By using pointers, you can access and modify the contents of a variable indirectly.

In Go, you can declare a pointer variable by prefixing an asterisk (*) before the variable name. For example:

```golang
var ptr *int
```

## How to use pointers?

To use a pointer, you need to assign it the memory address of a variable. You can obtain the memory address of a variable by using the ampersand (&) operator.

```golang
var a int = 42
var ptr *int = &a
```

To access the value of the variable through the pointer, you can use the dereference operator (*). This operator is used to retrieve the value that is stored at the memory location pointed to by the pointer variable.

```golang
fmt.Println(*ptr)
```

## Unsafe Pointers

This package allows you to work with memory in a way that is not type-safe or guaranteed to be safe. Therefore, you should only use the unsafe package if you know what youâ€™re doing and understand the risks.

The unsafe.Pointer type is used to represent a pointer to an arbitrary memory location. You can convert a pointer to a specific type to an unsafe pointer using the unsafe.Pointer() function.

```golang
var p *int = new(int)
unsafePtr := unsafe.Pointer(p)
```
