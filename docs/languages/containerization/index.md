# Containerization

__What is Containerization?__
Containerization is a software deployment process that bundles an application's code with all the files and libraries it needs to run on any infrastructure.

__Is [Docker]({% link docs/languages/containerization/docker.md %}) a virtual machine?__
A VM lets you run a virtual machine on any hardware. Docker lets you run an application on any operating system. It uses isolated user-space instances known as containers. Docker containers have their own file system, dependency structure, processes, and network capabilities.
