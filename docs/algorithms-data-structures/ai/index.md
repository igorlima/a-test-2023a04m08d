## What are: Embeddings? Vector Databases? Vector Search? kNN? ANN? [^1]

**Embeddings: "Making Your Data AI-Friendly"**.
Embeddings convert raw data into numerical representations that capture relationships and distances within the data. This lower-dimensional representation enhances the efficiency of AI applications.

**Vector Databases: "A Hub for Embeddings and Raw Data"**.
Vector databases provide a centralized repository for embeddings and the corresponding raw data. They facilitate efficient storage, retrieval, and management of these resources.

**Vector Search: "Beyond Keyword-Based Queries"**.
Vector search enables similarity-based queries over vector representations of data. Unlike keyword search, vector search retrieves results based on distance metrics, providing more contextually relevant matches.

**Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): "Finding the Closest Matches"**.
k-NN is an algorithm that retrieves the k most similar data points to a given query embedding. It is commonly used in applications such as recommendation systems and anomaly detection.

**Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN): "A Faster Alternative to k-NN"**.
ANN algorithms provide approximate solutions to the nearest neighbor problem. They sacrifice accuracy in favor of significantly reduced computation time, making them suitable for large-scale data analysis and real-time applications.
