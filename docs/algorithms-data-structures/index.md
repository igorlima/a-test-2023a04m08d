## A/B test experiment

__What is an A/B Test?__ [^1]
An A/B test is a type of testing in which two variations of an app are released for testing to an isolated user segment before being deployed to the entire user base to collect metrics and feedback. One variation is designated variation A, and the other is designated variation B. Variation A usually represents the current version of the app and is considered a control or benchmark variation, while variation B represents the version of the app with the new feature to be tested.
__The role feature flags play.__
Feature flags are virtual switches that you can integrate into your app to control what features users can and cannot see.

## Data Races

Data Races are the toughest and the most time-consuming thing to debug. [^2]
